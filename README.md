# Voice Screen Share

Voice channel screen share has always existed, but required you to click a jump link into the channel to access it.
This plugin allows you to jump into screen share by ctrl-clicking the voice channel you're in, or
ctrl-clicking the channel name next to the voice connection status.

This is different from Go Live. You don't need to be playing a detected game, and you can share any window or
the whole screen. Just join any voice channel and ctrl-click.

This can be detected by Discord, but I doubt they'll care. This feature is actually live in a few servers, and for servers where it's not, it can still be accessed without client mods thanks to jump links.

## Plugin interactions

This plugin will always be loaded after doubleClickVoice, which means they won't interact. This means that even
if you have doubleClickVoice installed, you still only need to click the channel once to access screen share.
